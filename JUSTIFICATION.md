# Assignment 2 Justification

If you think any of the questions within the sections are not applicable, please write "N/A".

## Section 1: Creation and Use of 3D Objects

### How have you fulfilled this requirement?

I have not fulfilled this requirement and will not receive marks for Section 1. 
(If you would like your Section 1 to be marked, you will need to replace these lines)

### 1a: Show that you have created or imported at least one 3D object that is visible in your application. Include references to where this is implemented in your code.

I have not completed part 1a. (If you would like your 1a to be marked, you will need to replace this line)

### 1b: Describe your scene graph and the hierarchy within the scene. Include references to where this is implemented in your code.

I have not completed part 1b. (If you would like your 1b to be marked, you will need to replace this line)

### 1c: Describe how your objects are moving or animating in realtime. Include code references (line numbers and function names) to use of delta time and also how this affects the scene graph.

I have not completed part 1c. (If you would like your 1c to be marked, you will need to replace this line)

### 1d: Describe how you have used parametric splines in your application. Include code references to the implementation of control point based curves in your project.

I have not completed part 1d. (If you would like your 1d to be marked, you will need to replace this line)

## Section 2: Camera

### How have you fulfilled this requirement?

I have not fulfilled this requirement and will not receive marks for Section 2. 
(If you would like your Section 2 to be marked, you will need to replace these lines)

### 2a: Describe what controls the player should use to move the camera in your scene. Include code references to the implementation of delta time control of speed and use of user input in your project.

I have not completed part 2a. (If you would like your 2a to be marked, you will need to replace this line)

### 2b: Describe how your camera interacts with the scene. Is it able to "walk" on the Z-X plane or follow terrain? Include code references.

I have not completed part 2b. (If you would like your 2b to be marked, you will need to replace this line)

### 2c: Describe how the view of your scene can change from player controlled to application controlled (specify user input that makes this change happen). Include code references to use of parametric curves and delta time in the application controlled camera.

I have not completed part 2c. (If you would like your 2c to be marked, you will need to replace this line)

## Section 3: Lighting

### How have you fulfilled this requirement?

I have not fulfilled this requirement and will not receive marks for Section 3. 
(If you would like your Section 3 to be marked, you will need to replace these lines)

### 3a: Describe where Diffuse Lighting is clear to see in your application. Include code references to your implemented lighting (including where this is implemented in your shaders).

I have not completed part 3a. (If you would like your 3a to be marked, you will need to replace this line)

### 3b: Describe where Specular Lighting is clear to see in your application, including how the camera position affects the lighting. Include code references to your implemented lighting (including where this is implemented in your shaders).

I have not completed part 3b. (If you would like your 3b to be marked, you will need to replace this line)

### 3c: Describe which of your light(s) in your scene are point light(s) and how you have placed objects in the scene to clearly show the point lights functioning. Include code references to point light implementation.

I have not completed part 3c. (If you would like your 3c to be marked, you will need to replace this line)

### 3d: Describe all the lights in your scene and what type they are. Include code references to implementation of the capability to work with an arbitrary number of lights.

I have not completed part 3d. (If you would like your 3d to be marked, you will need to replace this line)

### 3e: Explain what maps you have used and which objects they are on. Your application should clearly show the effect these maps are having on lighting. Include code references to maps on objects and vertices as well as lighting code that uses the maps.

I have not completed part 3e. (If you would like your 3e to be marked, you will need to replace this line)

## Section 4: Subjective Mark

### How have you fulfilled this requirement?

I have not fulfilled this requirement and will not receive marks for Section 4. 
(If you would like your Section 4 to be marked, you will need to replace these lines)
